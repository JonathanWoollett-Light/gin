# Gin

Like [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) but simpler.

## Installation

See [Poetry installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

```
poetry install
poetry run pytest -s
```

## Todo

- Implement [HDF5](https://www.h5py.org/) or [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) for better dataset handling.
